## 📖 Introduction

Welcome to my repository of write-ups for [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.com/) machines and challenges. 

I created this repository to document my learning journey, refine my methodology, and share knowledge with the InfoSec community. Each write-up details the reconnaissance, scanning, enumeration, and exploitation steps I took to capture the flags.

> **Note:** These write-ups are for educational purposes only.
